            <p>You are invited to take part in a research study named Interaction Effect of Risk, Time, and Reward in Time Lotteries. The study is designed to better understand how people navigate complex choices that involve juggling several factors at once. If you agree to be in this study, you will view two distinct lottery options, compare them, and try to pick the option you prefer the most. This study will be conducted by Weilin(Will) Zhang or Zixi(Alicia) Wang FAS - Psychology, Arts & Science, New York University, as a part of their Faculty-directed Research. Their faculty sponsor is Professor Laurence T. Maloney, Department of FAS - Psychology, Arts & Science, New York University.</p>

            
            <p>

                In this study, you will make decisions between different lottery options displayed on a computer screen. Each lottery is characterized by its reward value, probability of winning, and a delay in months before receiving the reward. Your task is to select the option you prefer most based on these factors.
                There is no right or wrong answer, as this is a preference-based task. We are interested in understanding how you weigh different probabilities, rewards, and delays when making decisions.
                You will receive training and practice to familiarize yourself with the task before the main experiment begins.
                At the end of the experiment, your responses will be recorded, and you will receive a base compensation of $15, along with a bonus.
                </p>

            
            <p>As part of this study, some randomly selected trials will be designated as real lotteries. In these trials, the lottery you choose will be executed, meaning that the computer will determine whether you win based on the probability associated with your choice. If you win, you will receive 1% of the displayed lottery amount as a bonus payment in addition to your base compensation. For example, if you choose a $500 lottery with a 30% chance, the program will execute the outcome. If the program determines that you win, you will receive $5 as a bonus; if you lose, you receive nothing for that trial. You will receive feedback on the outcome of the real lotteries, but for all other trials, you will proceed to the next decision without feedback. At the end of the experiment, your total bonus payment will be calculated and added to your compensation. The bonus will be paid according to the time of the lottery you picked.</p>
            <p>Participation in this study will involve an hour or less of your time. There are no known risks associated with your participation in this research beyond those of everyday life. Although you will receive no direct benefits, this research may help the investigator understand how humans make decisions in complex scenarios.</p>
            <p>Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained. The data we collect cannot be linked to you and the summary of the data published in journal articles also cannot be linked to you. Data will be kept at least until 5 years after publication, as recommended by the American Psychological Association. 
            </p>
            <p>Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without penalty. For interviews, questionnaires, or surveys, you have the right to skip or not answer any questions you prefer not to answer. Not taking part or withdrawing after the study has begun will result in no loss of services from NYU to which you are otherwise entitled; and if you are an NYU student, it will not affect your grades or academic standing in any way. If you choose to withdraw before completing all 400 trials, you will receive a pro-rated payment of $7.50, which is half of the base payment. </p>
            <p>If there is anything about the study or your participation that is unclear or that you do not understand, if you have questions or wish to report a research-related problem, you may contact
